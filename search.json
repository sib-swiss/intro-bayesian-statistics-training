False means that the statement does not follow logically from Bumbledorf’s result. Also note that all, several, or none of the statements may be correct.\n\nThe probability that the true mean is greater than 0 is at least 95%.\nThe probability that the true mean equals 0 is smaller than 5%.\nThe “null hypothesis” that the true mean equals 0 is likely to be incorrect.\nThere is a 95% probability that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.\nWe can be 95% confident that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.\nIf we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95% of the time the true mean falls between 0.1 and 0.4.\n\nWhich statements are true and which are false?\n\n\n2.3 Probability\n\n\nWhat is the probability of A and B?\n\n\n2.4 Conditional probability\n\n\nWhat is the probability of A given B?\n\n\n2.5 Bayes theorem\n\n\nWhat is the probability the winning family has two daughters?\n\n\n2.6 Bayes theorem and p-values\n\n\n\n\n2.exercises\n Download the exercise instructions \n Download the exercise solutions \n\nThank you for completing the pre-course content."
